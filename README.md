# Machine-learning-projects
University projects in the courses COSE474 Deep Learning and MATH292 Mathematics for AI from Korea University.

## Deep Learning Project 1 (MLP Implementation):
This project contains a two layered neural network from scratch. It can calculate a forecast for the input data (in this case CIFAR-10 dataset) and is able to be trained via backpropagation. The specific exercises and the model infrastructure can be looked up in the pdf-files. I found the original project at the Stanford website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/">CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition</a>.

## Deep Learning Project 2 (CNN Architecture Implementation):
This project treats a pytorch environment in which the CIFAR10 dataset should be used. First of all the so called VGG-16 model was used and afterwards we had to fill in the missing pieces of the ResNet-50 model. Both models can be tested and the checkpoints are saved in the attached files.

## Math for AI Project 1 (Visualizing PCA):
This file contains a solution to a exam exercise in which we had to visualize a PCA of the Olivetti faces dataset. I completed the task in two ways. First I calculated the principal components and transformed the data back to the original bases to visualize the transformed faces in comparison to the original one. Secondly I plotted the data in a pairwise plot of each principle component to each other.
