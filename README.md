# Machine-learning-projects
University projects in the courses COSE474 Deep Learning and MATH292 Mathematics for AI from Korea University.

## Deep Learning Project 1 (MLP Implementation):
<style>{margin: 2;}This project contains a two layered neural network from scratch. It can calculate a forecast for the input data (in this case CIFAR-10 dataset) and is able to be trained via backpropagation. The specific exercises and the model infrastructure can be looked up in the pdf-files. I found the original project at the Stanford website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/">CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition</a>.</style>
